# MetaHeuristics
This repository will be used for solving the Lab exercises and assignments that were assigned during the Master's course in AI
This readme will be updated with details of all the codes that will be uploaded

# First file in this repository is TSP.py and description is as below:

1) TSP.py: This is a solution to the Travelling salesman problem, which uses nearest neighbor insertion method.
   This script takes two parameters, 1. input file name which has the city ID x-coordinates y-coordinates (for all the cities under consideration)
                                     2. output file name, which will have the total distance travelled as first line and the city ids that are visited in order
   Minimum distances are calculated using Euclidian distance method
